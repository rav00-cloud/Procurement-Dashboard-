# Procurement-Dashboard-Procurement Dashboard - ReadMe

Project Overview

The Procurement Dashboard is a Power BI-driven analytical tool designed to streamline procurement operations by providing deep insights into supplier performance, cost efficiency, payment tracking, and procurement officer efficiency. This dashboard helps businesses make data-driven decisions to enhance operational effectiveness and financial control.

Key Problems & Solutions

1. Supplier Performance & Late Deliveries

Problem: Inefficiencies caused by unreliable suppliers lead to delayed shipments and disruptions in operations.

Solution: The dashboard evaluates supplier performance by tracking order fulfillment rates, identifying late deliveries, and assessing cancellation trends. Decision-makers can use this insight to renegotiate contracts or find alternative suppliers.

2. Cost Optimization & Budgeting

Problem: Difficulty in identifying high-cost procurement areas and reducing unnecessary expenditures.

Solution: By segmenting costs based on suppliers, categories, and locations, businesses can pinpoint excessive spending areas, identify cost-effective suppliers, and enhance budget allocations to improve financial efficiency.

3. Payment Management & Overdue Invoices

Problem: Lack of a structured approach to track outstanding invoices, leading to cash flow issues.

Solution: The dashboard provides real-time visibility into pending, overdue, and paid invoices. It categorizes transactions based on payment terms (Net 30, Net 90, etc.), ensuring timely follow-ups and improved cash flow management.

4. Procurement Efficiency & Lead Time Management

Problem: Extended procurement cycles and lack of visibility into order processing times.

Solution: The dashboard measures lead times from order placement to delivery, helping businesses identify bottlenecks and optimize procurement timelines. This ensures quicker order fulfillment and better supplier collaboration.

5. Procurement Officer Performance Monitoring

Problem: Difficulty in assessing procurement officers' efficiency and accountability.

Solution: The dashboard tracks procurement officers' order processing efficiency, on-time delivery success rates, and cost management effectiveness. It enables organizations to recognize high performers and provide training where necessary.
